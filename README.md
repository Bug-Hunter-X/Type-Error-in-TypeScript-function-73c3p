This repository contains a TypeScript code example demonstrating a common type error and its solution. The `bug.ts` file shows the code with the error, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version. The error arises from passing an object with an extra property to a function expecting a specific type. The solution involves either modifying the function signature to accept the extra property or adjusting the object being passed to match the expected type.  This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript and demonstrates how to effectively debug and resolve type-related issues.
